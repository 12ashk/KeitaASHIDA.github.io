I'm Keita ASHIDA, a PhD student in [Oka Lab](https://www.bpni.bio.keio.ac.jp/) at Keio University, Japan.
I am interested in neuroscience with quantitative biological approach, and am currently working on input-output relationship of a neuron in _Caenorhabditis elegans_.

This article revealed that chemotactic behavior of a nematode is affected by around worms. The worms modulated turning behavior againt odor decrease by their pheromone. I mainly performed computer simulation of odor diffusion in this paper.
